# Introduction
In this lab, I will be building a mini honey net using Azure and open it up for the internet, so that the attackers can target the vulnerable Azure virtual machine. While the VM get's attacked we will be getting ingesting the log from various attackers into Log analytics workspace, Which later on will be used by Microsoft Sential to build attack maps and let us know from which part of the world attackers are targeting our VM.
