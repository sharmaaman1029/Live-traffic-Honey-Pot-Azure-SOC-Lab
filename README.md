# Introduction
In this lab, I will deploy a mini honeynet in Microsoft Azure and expose it to the internet so that adversaries can target a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine. During attacks, we will ingest attacker logs into an Azure Log Analytics workspace. These logs will be analyzed with Microsoft Sentinel to generate attack maps and identify the geographic origins of the attacks.
